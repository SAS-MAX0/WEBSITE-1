<button type="button" onclick='document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Did you know? The first computer programmer was a woman named Ada Lovelace! In the mid-1800s, she wrote the first algorithm designed for implementation on Charles Babbages Analytical Engine, making her the worlds first computer programmer, well before the modern computer era. Did you know? The worlds smallest computer, the Michigan Micro Mote (M3), is only 0.3 mm on each side! Its so tiny that it can be compared to a grain of rice. Despite its minuscule size, it has the ability to sense temperature and track eye movements, showcasing the incredible advancements in microtechnology. </n> Did you know? The term bug in computer science originated in 1947 when a moth caused a malfunction in the Harvard Mark II computer. Grace Hopper, a computer scientist, found and removed the moth from the machine, documenting it in the logbook as the first actual case of bug being found. This incident led to the popular use of the term debugging for fixing computer glitches. Did you know? The worlds fastest supercomputer, as of 2022, is Fugaku, developed by RIKEN and Fujitsu in Japan. Fugaku can perform over 442 petaflops, meaning it can perform 442 quadrillion calculations per second. This supercomputer is utilized for various scientific applications, including climate research, drug discovery, and materials science. Did you know? The Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969 would not have been possible without the guidance of a computer. The Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) aboard the spacecraft had only 2,048 words of erasable memory and 36,864 words of read-only memory. Despite its limited capabilities compared to todays technology, it successfully executed the complex calculations needed for the lunar landing."'>Click Me!</button>
